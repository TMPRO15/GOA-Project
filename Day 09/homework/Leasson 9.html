      <p>Step 1</p>
      <li>if you have a pizza stone, you should let it get hot 
        in the oven about 425 degrees F.</li>
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <li>This step takes some practice. gently shape the dough into a pizza 
        circle utilising gravity to help it shap.. It takes a little practice and watching 
        the guys at the pizza shop helps, just don't attempt to throw it in the air, cause that is really more 
        for show.. although if I could do it that way, I would.. Once it is rounded and 
        begins to stay that way, you can punch the dough a 
        little while it is lying flat on the counter/cutting board.</li>
      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      <li>I like to layer the cheese then pepperoni last.. 
        with all other ingredients underneath itFirst cover with the sauce, 
        then add the mushrooms and bacon, next cilantro and cheese and 
        finally add the pepperoni.</li>
        <h2>Step 4</h2>
        <li>425 for about 20- 25 minutes 
            then let it set for a
            bout 5 mins and enjoy.</li>
